# Part 1: The Problem and The Solution

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll experience the difference between undocumented and documented APIs firsthand. You'll work with the SAME API in two different ways:

1. **Without documentation** - Try to figure out how to use it
2. **With Swagger/OpenAPI** - See how much easier it becomes

---

## Activity 1: The Undocumented API (10 minutes)

### Scenario

Your teammate built a "Books API" but didn't document it. They just sent you this message:

> "Hey! I deployed the Books API. It works, just figure it out!"

You need to integrate with this API, but you have no documentation.

### Setup

```bash
cd 01-problem-and-solution
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
python undocumented_api.py
```

The API is now running at http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Your Task

Using only Postman or curl, try to answer these questions:

1. **What endpoints exist?**
   - Hint: Try `/books`, `/api/books`, etc.
  Books: 404 Error
  /api/books: funciona

2. **What HTTP methods does each endpoint support?**
   HEAD, GET, OPTIONS, POST

1. **For POST requests:**
   - What fields are required? author, title 
   - What format is expected? json

2. **What do the responses look like?**
Cuerpo (Body): Un objeto JSON que contiene una lista bajo la clave "books".
Contenido del objeto: Cada libro (author, id, isbn, title, year).
"books": 
        {
            "author": "George Orwell",
            "id": 1,
            "isbn": "978-0451524935",
            "title": "1984",
            "year": 1949
        },

1. **Are there query parameters?**
Filtering: Prueba con ?author=Harper+Lee. La lista se filtra, el parámetro existe.
Pagination: Prueba con ?page=1 o ?limit=5. La cantidad de resultados cambia

### Track Your Experience

While exploring, note:
- How long does it take to figure things out?
- How many errors do you encounter?
- How confident are you that you found everything?
- How frustrated do you feel?

**Stop the API (Ctrl+C) when you're done exploring.**

## Activity 2: The Documented API (10 minutes)

### Now With Swagger UI!

Let's see the SAME API, but with proper documentation.

### Setup

```bash
# Make sure you're in the same directory
python documented_api.py
```

### Explore the Swagger UI

Open your browser and go to: **http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs**

You'll see Swagger UI - interactive API documentation.

### Your Task

Explore the Swagger UI and answer these questions:

1. **Endpoint Discovery** 
POST: /api/books
GET: /api/books
DELETE: /api/books/{id}
GET: /api/books/{id} 
PUT: /api/books/{id}

1. **Interactive Testing** 

   Try these operations using "Try it out":

   - **GET /api/books**
     - Execute it
     - Try filtering: add `author=Orwell` parameter
     - Try pagination: add `page=1&limit=2`

   - **POST /api/books**
     - See the request body schema
     - Use the example or create your own book
     - Execute and see it created

   - **GET /api/books/{id}**
     - Try with ID 1 (should work)
     - Try with ID 999 (should return 404)

   - **PUT /api/books/{id}**
     - Update a book's title

   - **DELETE /api/books/{id}**
     - Delete a book
     - Try to GET it again (should be 404)

2. **Understanding Schemas** (2 minutes)
   - Scroll down to "Schemas" section
   - Expand the "Book" schema
   - See all fields and their types
   - Notice required vs optional fields

### Bonus: View the OpenAPI Spec

Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/swagger.json to see the raw OpenAPI specification. This file can be:
- Imported into Postman (you'll do this next!)
- Used to generate client SDKs
- Shared with other developers

## Reflection Questions

Compare both experiences and answer:

### Time Efficiency
- **Undocumented API:** How long to understand it? _______
- **Documented API:** How long to understand it? _______
- **Time saved:** _______

### Confidence
- How confident were you about using the undocumented API? (1-10): _____
- How confident are you about using the documented API? (1-10): _____

### Developer Experience
- Which would you prefer to integrate with in a real project?
- What specific features of Swagger UI were most helpful?
- Could you use the documented API without asking anyone questions?

### Real-World Impact
- If you were building a production application, which API would you trust?
- How would documentation affect your team's productivity?
- What happens when the API changes?

## Key Takeaways

### What You Just Experienced:

**Without Documentation:**
- Trial and error
- Wasted time guessing
- Uncertain about completeness
- Fear of missing features
- Need to ask developer constantly

**With Swagger/OpenAPI:**
- Self-service exploration
- Clear schemas and examples
- Interactive testing
- Confidence in completeness
- Independent integration

### Why This Matters:

In real projects:
- APIs change frequently
- Multiple teams integrate (frontend, mobile, partners)
- Documentation must stay in sync with code
- Onboarding new developers happens often

**OpenAPI solves all of this by:**
- Auto-generating docs from code (never out of sync!)
- Providing a standard format (works with all tools)
- Enabling interactive testing (faster development)
- Creating a contract (frontend/backend alignment)

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen the value of API documentation, let's see how it integrates with tools you already use.
